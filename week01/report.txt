Week01 taught us about scripting in CLI, such as :
- "cd" to change directory
- "cd .." to go to the parent directory
- "mkdir" to make a new directory
- "ls -al" to list all files and folders in current directory
- "touch" to create new file
- "rm" to remove a file
- "vi" to create a file using vi editor
- "nano" to create a file using nano editor
- "mv" to move a file/folder
- "pwd" to verify current directory
- and doing pull, push, and commit to our repository
